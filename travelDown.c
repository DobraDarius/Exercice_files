/*A field is represented as a matrix A with m rows and n columns. The elements A(i, j), which belong to the set of real numbers, represent the elevations 
(heights) of different parts of the land. It is assumed that a ball is on a portion A(a, b) (read from the keyboard).
Specify all the routes that can be followed by the ball so that it leaves the field, knowing that it can move on any adjacent part of the field with a level 
strictly lower than the level of the field on which the ball is located.
Present and argue the choice of algorithm and data structures.

Exemplify the operation of the algorithm for a minimum 3Ã—3 matrix.*/
